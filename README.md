# ASP.NET Core and Docker Workshop

## Setup

1. Clone Locally

## What You'll Be Building

In this workshop you will build a simple ASP.NET Core API from scratch. The API will have two endpoints, one returning data via HTTP GET and the other accepting data via HTTP POST.

You'll then create a Docker image for your API and run it as a Docker container.
